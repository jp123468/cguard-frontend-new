/**
 * Browser device signals sent with sign-in / sign-up.
 *
 * WHY: the backend already records the client IP and resolves it to a country
 * offline (superadmin → "Origen y ubicación"). An IP answers *where*; it does
 * not answer *which device* — and residential IPs rotate, so one person opening
 * several accounts looks like several people. FingerprintJS (OSS build, MIT)
 * gives a stable per-browser id that closes that gap, plus the browser's OWN
 * timezone/locale, which is what exposes a proxied signup (IP resolves to one
 * country, browser insists it is in another).
 *
 * These values are a REVIEW SIGNAL ONLY. They are computed in the browser and
 * therefore forgeable — the backend stores them for a human to look at and
 * never uses them for authentication or authorisation.
 *
 * Cost control: the library (~35 KB) is dynamically imported, so it stays out of
 * the main bundle and is only fetched on the auth screens. Everything is wrapped
 * so that a blocked/failed fingerprint NEVER delays or breaks a login.
