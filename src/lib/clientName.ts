/**
 * The ONE way to turn a client record into the label shown under "Cliente".
 *
 * A `clientAccount` carries two different identities and they are easy to mix up:
 *   - `commercialName` → the COMPANY ("Comercial Ecuador S.A."). Canonical.
 *   - `name` + `lastName` → the PERSON: a denormalized cache of the linked user,
 *     i.e. the legal representative / contact.
 *
 * Screens that rendered `${name} ${lastName}` under a "Cliente" label showed a
 * person where the operator expected a company — nobody recognises the client by
 * their legal rep. Always route client labels through this helper.
 *
 * Falls back to the person's name only when there is no commercialName at all,
 * because an empty cell is worse than an imperfect one.
