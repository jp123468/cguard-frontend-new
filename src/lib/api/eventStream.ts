/**
 * Opens the tenant SSE event stream.
 *
 * NOTE: events routes are mounted at `/api/:tenantId/events/*` (no `/tenant/`
 * segment), unlike the rest of the tenant API.
 *
 * SECURITY: EventSource cannot send headers, so the auth credential is passed in
 * the query string. Putting the long-lived session JWT in the URL leaks it into
 * server/proxy access logs, browser history, and Referer headers. The proper fix
 * is a backend-issued short-lived, single-purpose SSE ticket (or cookie-based
 * stream auth) — this helper centralizes the call site so that migration only
 * has to change here. Until the backend exposes a ticket endpoint, this falls
 * back to the session token. Stream URLs should be excluded from access logging.
 *
 * @returns the EventSource, or null if prerequisites (tenant/token/base) are missing.
